# Help support FredBoat♪♪
We love bringing music right to your Discord Server through FredBoat♪♪. Ever since the launch of FredBoat♪♪, it has grown in popularity at an incredible rate. Improvements are constantly being made to the bot, but the largest challenge is providing enough server power. We have over 400k FredBoat♪♪ bots floating out there in the Discord ocean and, often, 2k+ deployed at any given time!

The amount of server power required to maintain FredBoat♪♪'s standard of quality is expensive. You can support the development and maintenance of FredBoat♪♪ and enjoy some premium features, too!

## Perks of donating
As a patron of $2 or more per month you will gain access to FredBoat Patron in one server of your choosing including:

1. An isolated bot that is __not affected by peak usage__ (eg. less lag)
2. The ability to __add Spotify playlists__ with tracks found on YouTube and Soundcloud
3. The __;;volume command__, which allows you to change the volume of the bot for everyone
4. Earn the __Patron role__ in FredBoat Hangout

%PATREON_BUTTON%
Once you have become a Patron you can remotely add the bot by going to www.patron.fredboat.com!

## One-off donations
You may also donate via PayPal if you wish, __but I am unable to provide the patron bot to PayPal donators.__
